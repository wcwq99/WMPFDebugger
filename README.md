# WMPFDebugger

[English](README.md) | [中文](README.zh.md)

Yet another WeChat miniapp debugger on Windows (WMPF).

This debugger (tweak) exploits Remote Debug feature provided by wechatdevtools and patches serval restrictions to force miniapp runtime to support full Chrome Debug Protocol, and thus can be directly applied to standard devtools shipped with chromium-based browsers.

To debug web pages of WeChat embedded browser, please refer to [EXTENSION.md](EXTENSION.md). Note that this feature has many limitations currently and is simply a basic workaround.

**For AI-powered automatic reverse engineering of miniapps**, see [AI_INTEGRATION.md](AI_INTEGRATION.md) for instructions on integrating with [AI_JS_DEBUGGER](https://github.com/Valerian7/AI_JS_DEBUGGER).

To check your installed version, navigate to Task Manager -> WeChatAppEx -> Right click -> Open file location -> Check the number between `RadiumWMPF` and `extracted`.

To adapt to another version, please find the instructions in [ADAPTATION.md](ADAPTATION.md). Alternatively, you can submit an issue for new version adaption and I will try that if I have the binary. Note that only newer version adaption requests will be considered.


To upgrade to the latest WMPF (WeChat version > 4.x), download the latest WeChat installer on `pc.weixin.qq.com`. The latest WMPF bundle is packaged with the installer.

To upgrade to the latest WMPF (WeChat version < 4.x), type in `:showcmdwnd` in the search bar (do not hit enter), then the command window should pop up. Type in `/plugin set_grayvalue=202&check_update_force` and hit enter, the latest WMPF plugin should be downloaded, if any updates are available. Restart the WeChat to apply plugin upgrade.

## Prerequisites

* node.js (requires at least LTS v22)
    - yarn
* chromium-based browsers (e.g., Chrome, Edge, etc.)

## Quick Start

**Step 1.** Clone this repo and install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evi0s/WMPFDebugger
cd WMPFDebugger
yarn
```

**Step 2.** Run `src/index.ts` to launch debug server and proxy server, and inject hook script to miniapp runtime.

```bash
npx ts-node src/index.ts
```

> Note: After this step, you need to launch the miniapp BEFORE launching the devtools, otherwise you will probably need to kill the server and redo the steps 2 to 4 again.

**Step 3.** Launch any miniapp you would like to debug.

**Step 4.** Open your chromium-based browsers, navigate to `devtools://devtools/bundled/inspector.html?ws=127.0.0.1:62000` and profit. You can change the CDP port `CDP_PORT` (62000 in this example) in `src/index.ts` to any port you like.
